As a fun project I would like to make a meme crypto coin to get more familiar
with web3 and also be able to say I'm a billionaire(in tomato coin). 
I also need to get used to working on multiple files that all interconnect with
one another, because until now, I have only made files that run by themselves.

Below is a rough guidline on the order of operations on how I'm building my crypto
coin below.

1. make the working git repo (because I need the practice hehe)

2. using the web3.js or ethers.js I will make a front end API

3. use hardhat to streamline the backend development

4. Use openzepplin to "cheat" and make a functional working smart contract
that comply with industry standards. I want to work smarter, not harder.

5. Use hardhat to create a testing network to test functionality
connect metamask to testing network
